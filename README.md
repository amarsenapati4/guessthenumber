#Guess the Number Game with DOM Manipulation
Welcome to the "Guess the Number" game, a beginner-friendly project that help me to learn JavaScript and DOM manipulation. In this project, I have create a simple game where the player guesses a random number. I have use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build the game, and along the way, i have gain hands-on experience with DOM (Document Object Model) manipulation.

##Getting Started
Follow these steps to get started with the game:

**Clone the Repository:** Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

**Open index.html:** Open the index.html file in your web browser. This is where you will play the game.

**Open script.js:** In your code editor, open the script.js file. This is where I have written the JavaScript code to make the game work.

##How the Game Works
In this game, the computer selects a random number between a specified range, and the player's goal is to guess the correct number. The game will provide feedback (too high, too low, or correct guess) and keep track of the number of attempts.

#Learning Outcomes
As a beginner, I have the opportunity to learn and practice several fundamental concepts:

**DOM Manipulation:** I have manipulate the HTML DOM to update and display the game's information, such as the number of attempts and feedback messages.

**JavaScript Logic:** Write JavaScript code to handle user input, generate random numbers, compare guesses, and provide feedback.

**Styling:** Customize the game's appearance using CSS. Make it visually engaging and responsive.

**Game Logic:** Implement the game's core logic, including generating random numbers and managing user input.

##Resources
To get started, here are some resources that can become useful for me:

**MDN Web Docs:** A comprehensive guide to JavaScript and DOM manipulation.
**W3Schools:** A great resource for learning JavaScript.
